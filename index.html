		<p style="color:#F7EBEC;">The world was created in the year of 1944 on the 7th day of November, everything before that was a story created by 
		his divine majesty Danny DeVito, the location for his immaculate birth was in the Neptune Township in the state of New 
		Jersey in the United States of America. Just like every myth Danny came from a humble background, he was raised my his 
		Mother, Julia, and father, Danny Sr., who was a small business owner with many different ventures including dry cleaner, 
		luncheonette, dairy outlet and pool hall. A little known fact is that Danny was kid napped and partially raised by a pack 
		of wild junk yard dogs which taught him magic and how to control things with his mind.<br>
		At a young age DeVito had grown to his staggering height of 4 foot 10 inches or 147 centimeters, which according to scientists 
		is the proper height for a God, however Danny was bullied by other children who weren't aware of his magical abilities. In 
		high School Danny had participated in theater but never considered acting and he ended up working with his sister in her salon. 
		After a year and a half of working at the salon he decided to go to school for cosmetics and ended up taking acting classes. 
		After university Danny work with a theater company on the east coast and after a while he tried his hand at film acting on the 
		west coast, but after some failed auditions he ended up moving back to the east coast and acted in several off-broadway shows.<br>
		When he landed a role in a off broadway production of <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> it ended up landing him a role
		in the film version, after that DeVito was thrown into the nation spotlight, where he belonged, and has been ever since. He has 
		since worked on films and tv shows such as: It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Taxi, Matilda, Batman, and many many more. He
		is also known for consuming and gifting eggs where ever he is since he also created the egg with his infinite wisdom and power.<br>
		It is a known fact that Danny in an immortal being and there for can not die and he will keep acting in and producing <br> amazing 
		content long after we have all died and the world has been destroyed.</p>
